//! Unified Job Registry for tracking all async work in goose.
//!
//! Every background operation (subagent, process, MCP resource subscription,
//! long-running tool call) is represented as a Job with consistent lifecycle,
//! notification, and tracking semantics.
//!
//! ## State Machine
//!
//! ```text
//! Working → Complete
//! Working → Failed
//! Working → Canceled
//! Working → InputRequired → Working (after input provided)
//! Working → (event: PatternMatched) → still Working
//! ```
